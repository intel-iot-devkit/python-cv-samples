# Motion Heatmap

This sample application is useful to see movement patterns over time. For example, it could be used to see the usage of entrances to a factory floor over time, or patterns of shoppers in a store.

## What youâ€™ll learn
  * Background subtraction
  * Application of a threshold
  * Accumulation of changed pixels over time
  * Add a color/heat map

## Gather your materials
  *	Python\* 2.7 or greater
  * OpenCV version 3.3.0 or greater
  *	The vtest.avi video from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/data/vtest.avi
  * Directly use camera input `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)`

## Setup
1. You need the extra modules installed for the MOG background subtractor. This tutorial was tested on Windows\*, and the easiest way to install it was using:
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
`NOTE`: Not required to install opencv-contrib-python, if using opencv-python v4.2.0.

2. Download the vtest.avi video from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/data/vtest.avi and put it in the same folder as the python script. `cap = cv2.VideoCapture('vtest.avi', cv2.CAP_DSHOW)`
3. Run the python script. You should see a diff-overlay.jpg when it's done.

Code is included in this folder of the repository in the .py file.

## How it works
The main APIs used in OpenCV are:  
* MOG background subtractor (cv2.bgsegm.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG()) - https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/video/doc/motion_analysis_and_object_tracking.html?highlight=createbackgroundsubtractormog#createbackgroundsubtractormog  
Note: the docs are out of date, and the propoer way to initialize is  
```
cv2.bgsegm.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG()
```
`for opencv-python v4.2.0`
```
cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()
```
* cv2.threshold() - https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html   
* cv2.add() - https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html  
* cv2.applyColorMap() - https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/imgproc/doc/colormaps.html   
* cv2.addWeighted() - https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html  

The application takes each frame and first applies background subtraction using the cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2() object to create a mask. A threshold is then applied to the mask to remove small amounts of movement, and also to set the accumulation value for each iteration. The result of the threshold is added to an accumulation image (one that starts out at all zero and gets added to each iteration without removing anything), which is what records the motion. At the very end, a color map is applied to the accumulated image so it's easier to see the motion. This colored imaged is then combined with a copy of the first frame using cv2.addWeighted to accomplish the overlay.
